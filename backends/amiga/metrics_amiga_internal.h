/* Private to platform/amiga -- shared between metrics_amiga.c (owns the
   twips<->pixel conversion and the lazily-queried real screen DPI plus a
   metrics-only RastPort), draw_amiga.c (the plat_gc implementation,
   drawing in pixels through the window's own RastPort), and app_shell.c
   (which lays out text in twips via the engine and must convert to
   pixels with the SAME ratio before drawing, so line breaks measured by
   the engine land exactly where they're drawn -- same invariant
   platform/atari/metrics_atari_internal.h documents for its own target).

   Real per-axis DPI, unlike Atari's v_opnvwk (which reports true device
   pixel size in microns straight from VDI), has no equivalent "physical
   size" primitive in stock AmigaOS graphics.library below V45's
   GetDiskFontCtrl(DFCTRL_XDPI/YDPI) -- and even that queries a font-
   engine PREFERENCE, not real hardware, and needs diskfont.library V45
   (AmigaOS 3.9), far above this project's Kickstart 2.04+ floor. So
   metrics_amiga.c pins Y at 72 DPI -- not an arbitrary guess, but
   AmigaOS's own documented font-engine convention (diskfonttag.h's
   DFCTRL_YDPI comment: "Default is 72 dpi"; ta_YSize has always meant
   "pixels at 72dpi" by the same convention Mac/PostScript point sizing
   used) -- and derives X from a REAL, queried, per-mode value:
   DisplayInfo.Resolution (graphics/displayinfo.h), the actual
   ticks-per-pixel ratio for the current public screen's video mode
   (GetVPModeID + FindDisplayInfo + GetDisplayInfoData(DTAG_DISP), all
   real V36+ graphics.library calls -- within this project's floor).
   This is real, mode-derived data, not hardcoded -- see
   docs/amiga-platform.md for why a true physical DPI isn't obtainable
   here the way it is on the ST. */
