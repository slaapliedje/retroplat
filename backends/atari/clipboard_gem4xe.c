/* clipboard_gem4xe.c -- plat_clipboard_* on gem4xe.
 *
 * The convention is classic GEM's and is unchanged from the ST
 * (clipboard_atari.c): the scrap manager keeps a DIRECTORY, and the content
 * is a plain file called SCRAP.TXT inside it, so two programs that have
 * never heard of each other agree on a place rather than on a format.
 * Three things differ from the ST's file.
 *
 * FILES.  gem4xe has no stdio -- deliberately, because Calypsi's comes
 * from Apache NuttX and Apache 2.0 cannot be linked into the GPLv2 binary
 * gem4xe produces (gem4xe/docs/licence.md).  GEMDOS is what stdio would
 * have called anyway, so it is called directly, exactly as file_gem4xe.c
 * does for the plat_file seam.
 *
 * THE PATH BUFFER MUST BE NEAR.  scrp_read writes into the caller's
 * buffer and scrp_write reads out of it, and gem4xe hands the AES an
 * address as sixteen bits in bank $00 (WP_AES_NEAR in gemcompat.h).  A
 * path is also the one string too long for the far-string bounce the ABI
 * uses elsewhere -- gem.h says so where it declares these two, and the
 * AES's own buffer is SC_PATHLEN, 128 bytes, long enough for a full path
 * AND a filename.  So one near buffer of that size serves both calls, and
 * the near pool pays for it once.
 *
 * THE FALLBACK DRIVE IS ASKED FOR, NOT ASSUMED.  The ST's file falls back
 * to a literal "C:\\", which is right for its Hatari harddrive mount and
 * wrong here: gem4xe maps a GEM drive letter onto a SpartaDOS device by
 * position (src/sys/dos.c, dos_cioname -- A: is D1:, so C: is D3:), and on
 * a one-floppy machine, which is what this port has been run on, D3: does
 * not exist.  Dgetdrv answers the drive the program was started from, so
 * that is what the fallback names.
 *
 * BUFFERS ARE STATIC, NOT AUTOMATIC.  An application's near memory on
 * gem4xe -- which is where its stack is, because the 65816 stack is in
 * bank $00 by hardware -- comes out of a small pool.  The ST's version of
 * this file puts a 1 KB scrap buffer on the stack, which is unremarkable
 * on a machine with a 32 KB one and fatal here.  Declared static, the big
 * ones go to far BSS under --data-model=large and cost the pool nothing;
 * only the path buffer above is deliberately near. */
