 *
 * This backend builds against two AES bindings: the ST's (mintlib's gem.h
 * over a 68000) and gem4xe's (~/dev/gem4xe, GEM on an Atari 8-bit with a
 * 65816 in it). The AES contract is the same one in both -- the opcodes,
 * the object tree, the resource format -- and almost every line here is
 * written once and compiles for both. What differs is not behaviour but C
 * declaration, in two structures, and both differences are correct for the
 * machine that made them. So the facts live here rather than as #ifdefs
 * scattered through the backend.
 *
 * Detected by gem4xe's own include guard rather than by a build flag,
 * because the thing that actually differs is which gem.h is on the
 * include path.

 * in its own <gem.h> (they are one of its three COP faces), so including

 * that toolchain to include in any case.  One include, decided by which

/* MFDB_SET_ADDR -- assign a buffer to an MFDB's fd_addr.

 * model makes `void *` SIXTEEN bits, and an MFDB whose first field shrank
 * would shift every field after it and break every application that builds

/* OBJECT.ob_spec -- one union now, in both GEMs.
 *
 * This was the largest entry in this header.  mintlib declares ob_spec as
 * a UNION, so ST source says which half it means by naming a member:
 * `.free_string` for the char * a G_STRING, G_BUTTON or G_TITLE carries,
 * `.index` for the colour-and-border word a G_BOX, G_IBOX or G_BOXCHAR
 * carries (Compendium p.6.18).  gem4xe declared a bare LONG -- which is
 * what the ST's own aes.h has -- so every site needed two spellings and
 * the gem4xe one had to widen the LONG back to the far pointer it was
 * made from, by hand, in both directions.
 *
 * Since gem4xe 0b3b5b3 its gem.h declares the same union with the same
 * member names, and measured its layout in both data models rather than
 * assuming it: an OBJECT is 24 bytes with ob_spec at offset 12 either
 * way, a small-model pointer landing on the low word where the near
 * address is, a large-model one filling the long with the bank in byte 2.
 *
 * So these five are one definition each now, and this header no longer
 * has an opinion about ob_spec -- it only gives the operations names, so
 * the shell reads as intent rather than as union members.  The macros are
 * kept rather than deleted because 79 call sites spell them, and because
 * naming the operation is worth something even when both branches agree.
 *
 * The far/near question does not arise in the assignment: under
 * --data-model=large a `char *` IS far, and a `__near` string converts to
 * it by taking bank $00, which is where the AES reads these anyway.
 * Checked with the compiler, not by reasoning about it. */

/* FA_ERROR / FA_INFO -- the icon prefix of a form_alert string.
 *
 * These are gemlib's spelling, not the AES's: the alert string itself
 * carries the icon as "[n]" and both GEMs parse the same grammar, so all
 * that is needed here is the constant mintlib's mt_gem.h supplies
 * (FA_ERROR "[1]", FA_INFO "[4]").
 *
 * gem4xe draws three icons -- note, question, stop -- which is what
 * classic GEM has, and its al_icon() (src/aes/alert.c) sends anything
 * above 2 to stop.  "[4]" is a MagiC/XaAES extension, so FA_INFO maps to
 * the note icon here rather than arriving as a stop sign: an
 * informational alert with a stop sign on it says the wrong thing.
 *
 * Worth knowing on the ST as well: "[4]" is outside the 0-3 that plain
 * TOS documents, so what a Falcon under plain TOS draws for FA_INFO is
 * its own business and has not been checked on hardware. */

/* WP_AES_NEAR -- data the AES is going to be handed must live in bank $00.
 *
 * gem4xe's ABI passes an address to the AES as sixteen bits and supplies
 * the bank itself: src/sys/abi.c's near_of() takes the low word and the
 * AES reads it in bank $00.  That is not a limitation it apologises for
 * -- the AES, its object trees and its strings have always lived in one
 * bank, and making the ABI carry a bank byte would cost every call.
 *
 * It collides with --data-model=large, which is the model this port needs
 * for everything else: there, a global goes to far memory unless it says
 * otherwise, so an object tree declared the ordinary way lands in bank
 * $05 and the AES reads whatever is at its offset in bank $00.  Nothing
 * traps; the menu simply does not draw.  gemapp.scm says so in as many
 * words -- "a program that hands the AES a tree or a string must declare
 * those __near".
 *
 * So: anything whose ADDRESS crosses the seam is tagged with this, and
 * anything that merely holds the word processor's own data is not.  On
 * the ST it is nothing at all -- a 68000 has one address space and the
 * question does not arise. */

 * ob_spec was a bare LONG and Calypsi refused the braces C89 6.5.7 allows

/* WP_EVNT_MULTI -- one wait, two spellings.
 *
 * The AES call is the same underneath, and since gem4xe's kit grew
 * evnt_multi in the ST's own shape -- the Compendium's twenty-three
 * arguments, both mouse rectangles flat -- only one thing still differs:
 * gemlib joins the timer into a LONG, and the AES has always taken it as
 * two words.  So the seam here is this macro and nothing else.  The
 * adapter that used to build two MOBLKs is gone, and gemcompat_gem4xe.c
 * with it.
 *
 * `tm` is expanded twice, which a macro should be shy about.  It is left
 * so because the only caller in this tree passes a constant, and because
 * the alternative is the function just deleted; a caller wanting a
 * computed timeout should put it in a variable first.
 *
 * The cast to unsigned long before shifting is the point of that line: a
 * LONG is signed and right-shifting a negative one is
 * implementation-defined (C89 6.3.7).  Nothing here passes a negative
 * timeout, which is exactly why it must not be left to chance.
 *
 * Fixed arity rather than a variadic macro: this tree is C89, which has
 * no __VA_ARGS__. */
