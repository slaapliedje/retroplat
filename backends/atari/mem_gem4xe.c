/* mem_gem4xe.c -- mem_alloc/mem_free/mem_realloc on gem4xe.
 *
 * The ST's half of this seam (mem_atari.c) is mintlib's malloc, which
 * manages a pool it claims from GEMDOS once and hands back real free
 * space on free().  gem4xe's GEMDOS cannot be used that way, and says so
 * (gem4xe/src/sys/gemdos.h): "Malloc is the far heap: the bump
 * allocator, wound back when the application exits, so Mfree is a no-op
 * and a leak lasts one run."
 *
 * That is the right contract for the programs gem4xe was written for --
 * a desk accessory, a calculator, a shell that runs one program and
 * reclaims everything it touched.  It is the wrong one for an editor.
 * RetroWP frees on every run split, every undo push, every relayout; over
 * a session the engine allocates many times the size of the document it
 * is holding.  Against a no-op free, a 14.9 MB heap is not a large heap,
 * it is a long fuse.
 *
 * So the seam is met where it is defined rather than where it is
 * convenient: Malloc supplies ARENAS and a first-fit allocator runs
 * inside them.  Malloc is called a handful of times per run and Mfree
 * never, which is exactly the usage gem4xe's heap is built for.
 *
 * Arenas are chained, so there is no fixed ceiling: when no arena can
 * satisfy a request another is taken.  They are never given back -- that
 * IS the bump allocator's contract, and honouring it costs one Malloc per
 * 32 KB rather than a leak per free.
 *
 * WHY THE SENTINEL.  All arenas live on ONE address-ordered block list,
 * and coalescing merges a free block with the free block after it.  Two
 * arenas are not adjacent in memory, so merging across the join would
 * hand out a block spanning a gap.  Each arena therefore ends in a
 * zero-length block marked USED, which no merge will pass: the invariant
 * is kept by construction rather than by a comparison that has to be
 * right every time.
 *
 * far_alloc will not hand out a block that crosses a bank
 * (gem4xe/src/sys/farmem.c), so an arena is asked for in a size that
 * comfortably fits one. */
