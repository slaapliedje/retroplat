/* mintlib's clock() reads the ST's 200Hz system tick. Integer math only
   (no floats) -- CLOCKS_PER_SEC is a small integer constant here, not
   worth pulling in softfloat for.

   Scaled by dividing first and carrying the remainder, rather than the
   obvious c * 1000 / CLOCKS_PER_SEC: that multiply overflows 32 bits at
   c = 4,294,967 ticks, which at 200 Hz is about six hours of uptime --
   after which plat_ticks_ms stops being monotonic and starts answering
   nonsense, in a document the machine's owner has had open all day. This
   form holds until the millisecond count itself runs out of u32, at
   forty-nine days. gem4xe found it at CLOCKS_PER_SEC 1000, where the
   same line fails after seventy-one minutes (timer_gem4xe.c). */

           Correct here and NOT on gem4xe, where the AES is cooperative
           and a spin that never calls it starves the accessories for the
           whole span -- hence timer_gem4xe.c rather than an #ifdef. */
