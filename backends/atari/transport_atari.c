   the classic Bconin/Bconout/Bconstat/Bcostat convention -- verified
   against mint/ostruct.h, not guessed). No MiNTnet variant: FreeMiNT's
   BSD-socket GEMDOS extensions (Fsocket et al, function numbers
   0x160+) simply don't exist under plain TOS/EmuTOS, which is this
   project's target -- see docs/atari-platform.md for how that was
   confirmed. `endpoint` prefixes other than "serial:" (including
   "tcp:") are WP_UNSUPPORTED here, honestly, not silently accepted. */

/* endpoint format: "serial:<device>:<baud>[:<flow>]" (platform.h's own
   doc comment already establishes the first three fields). <device> is
   currently unused/unvalidated beyond "non-empty" -- the ST has exactly
   one serial port (AUX), so there is nothing to select, but the field is
   kept in the endpoint string for forward compatibility with the
   pipe:/tcp: endpoints' shape.

   BAUD CEILING. 19200 is not a limit this file invented: it is the top
   of Rsconf()'s speed table (BAUD_19200 == 0 in mint/ostruct.h, and the
   XBIOS #15 documentation lists exactly 0=19200 .. 15=50). On the ST
   that ceiling is the MFP 68901's timer-D baud generator. Machines with
   an SCC (Z85C30 -- Mega STE, TT, Falcon) can drive the line far faster,
   but not through this BIOS entry point: reaching those rates needs
   either HSMODEM (which extends the BIOS with additional speed indices)
   or direct SCC register programming (WR12/WR13 time constants), both of
   which are machine-specific and outside the plain-TOS baseline this
   backend targets. So the table below is complete and correct for the
   interface actually being used; a faster link is a separate piece of

/* Optional 4th endpoint field. OPT-IN ON PURPOSE, and the default stays

   serial rigs are wired with a 3-wire cable (TX/RX/GND only). On such a
   cable CTS is never asserted, so with FLOW_HARD selected Bcostat()
   never reports ready and every plat_transport_write would time out --
   a silent default of "hard" would turn a working link into a dead one.
   The caller has to say it wants handshaking, and is thereby asserting
   the cable actually carries RTS/CTS.

   Worth it where the cable does: FLOW_NONE with a polled BIOS AUX device
   has no way to push back on a fast sender, which is survivable for this
   protocol's short CRC-framed request/response traffic (a dropped byte
   costs one frame, and wire.c resyncs) but not for sustained bulk. */

   FLOW_SOFT is XON/XOFF: in-band CTRL-S (0x13) and CTRL-Q (0x11)
   (Compendium p.271, Rsconf's own flow table). This protocol's frames
   are binary -- the 4-byte length, the 2-byte sequence and the 2-byte
   CRC all take arbitrary values, so a payload of 17 bytes puts a literal
   0x11 in the length field and roughly one CRC in every 128 contains an
   0x11 or 0x13 byte. Those bytes would be consumed by the UART as flow
   characters and never reach wire.c, which sees a short frame and a CRC
   mismatch. Silent, intermittent, data-dependent corruption -- strictly
   worse than refusing the endpoint outright, and exactly the kind of
   fault that costs days to chase (see this file's own history).

/* Under plain TOS, AUX is a single global BIOS device and no per-open
   state beyond a non-NULL handle is strictly needed. Under MiNT there
   IS real state: an open file handle on a device node, which must be
   carried to every read/write and closed on the way out.

   WHY THE NODE EXISTS AT ALL. On a real Falcon030 under FreeMiNT, the
   BIOS path simply does not transmit. Measured on the machine: aux: is
   Bconmap device 7, Bconin over it receives perfectly (255 bytes of a
   known pattern, decoded clean), and Bconout over the SAME device moves
   zero bytes while Bcostat reports not-ready 31806, 36126 and 36072
   times across three different Rsconf configurations. Those three
   numbers landing within 1% of each other is the tell: MiNT intercepts
   the BIOS serial calls and routes them through its own driver, and
   Rsconf never reaches the state that driver is gating on -- so all
   three "different" configurations were the same no-op.

   Opening the device node instead and calling Fwrite moved 9863 bytes
   in six seconds on that same machine, with 9865 arriving at the far
   end (the extra two being unrelated boot noise already on the wire).
   Same port, same cable, same baud -- only the path through the OS
   differs.

   This was NOT a handshake problem, though it spent a long time looking
   like one. TIOCMGET on the node reports CTS=1: the wiring is good and
   the handshake is satisfied. Anything in this file's history implying
   a cable fault is superseded by that measurement. */
