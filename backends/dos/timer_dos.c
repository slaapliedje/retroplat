/* Open Watcom's own DOS libc clock() is driven by the BIOS system tick
   (INT 1Ah, ~18.2Hz) -- no raw interrupt calls needed, the same "just use
   the cross-compiler's own libc" shape platform/atari/timer_atari.c
   already uses for mintlib's own clock(). Integer math only, same
   reasoning as that file's own comment.

   The tick is 18.2Hz but CLOCKS_PER_SEC here is 1000: Watcom scales it, so
   clock() answers milliseconds in ~55ms steps. Granularity, not rate --
   and it means this file had the same overflow gem4xe's 1000Hz clock
   exposed (timer_gem4xe.c): c * 1000 before the divide overflows 32 bits
   at c = 4,294,967, which at this rate is seventy-one minutes of run time,
   after which plat_ticks_ms stops being monotonic. Dividing first and
   carrying the remainder holds to the forty-nine days a u32 millisecond
   count can express. */
