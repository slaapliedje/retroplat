/* Private to platform/mac -- shared between metrics_mac.c (owns the
   twips<->pixel conversion and the font/measuring-port implementation),
   draw_mac.c (the plat_gc implementation, drawing in pixels through a
   real window's port), and app_shell.c (which lays out text in twips
   via the engine and must convert to pixels with the SAME ratio before
   drawing, so line breaks measured by the engine land exactly where
   they're drawn -- same invariant platform/atari/metrics_atari_internal.h
   and platform/amiga/metrics_amiga_internal.h each document for their
   own target).

   Unlike Atari (real per-monitor DPI from v_opnvwk) or Amiga (no
   physical-DPI primitive below AmigaOS 3.9, so a per-mode tick ratio is
   queried instead), classic Mac OS needs neither: QuickDraw's whole
   coordinate system is built on a 72-DPI convention by design -- the
   original 1984 Macintosh's own 9" screen was exactly 72 pixels per
   inch, deliberately chosen so "one point" (1/72 inch, the same unit
   printer output uses) equals exactly one screen pixel, matching
   TextSize()'s own units (points) directly. This is architectural, not
   approximate -- every later Mac model in this project's target range
   keeps the same logical 72-DPI calibration regardless of a given
   monitor's real physical dot pitch. Twips are 1/20 point, so the
   conversion is an exact `/20` and `*20`, no rounding surprises. */
