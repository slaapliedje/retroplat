/* Private to backends/qt -- shared between metrics_qt.cpp (which owns the
   twips<->points conversion and the QFont) and draw_qt.cpp (the plat_gc
   implementation, painting through a QPainter). The same shared-internal-
   header pattern every other backend in this library uses.

   Qt sizes fonts in POINTS and a twip is 1/20 point, so the conversion is
   exact in both directions -- the same property the Mac backend gets from
   QuickDraw's 72 dpi and the GTK one got from Pango. All three are built on
   the printer's point rather than on a screen pixel.

   THIS IS THE ONLY C++ IN THE LIBRARY. The seam is C, so every plat_*
   definition here carries C linkage; nothing else about the build changes,
   and no class declares a signal or a slot, so there is no moc step. */
